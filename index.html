        <p>
            I am a data engineer with over five years of experience designing,
            building and maintaining modern data platforms.  My work focuses on
            creating scalable data pipelines, reliable data models and
            user‑friendly analytics layers that power business decision‑making.
            I partner with analytics, product and business stakeholders to
            translate requirements into technical solutions and deliver
            incremental value.

                <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Data scattered across SaaS apps and internal systems hindered analytics and decision‑making.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Architected an end‑to‑end data platform that ingests data via APIs, change‑data‑capture and streaming sources into Snowflake.  Orchestrated ELT pipelines using Airflow and modular transformations with dbt; enforced data quality rules with Great Expectations.  Deployed using Terraform and CI/CD pipelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Reduced data latency from hours to minutes, delivered a unified semantic layer for analytics and improved data reliability by 95%.</li>
